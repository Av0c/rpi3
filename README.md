Raspberry Pi sound sensor project.

This project turns a RPi3 into a sound sensor.

1. Configuration

1.1 Hardware configuration

 - Raspberry Pi 3 (older version may require different configurations).
 - USD sound card and microphone connection.
 - Ethernet connection (recommended).

1.2 Software configuration

 - "lusb" command can be used to check if USB sound card is properly mounted.
 - USB sound card must be set as default device by modifying 2 files:
    1) /etc/asound.conf
    2) /.asoundrc
   with the following contents:
       pcm.!default {
        type plug
        slave {
         pcm "hw:1,0"
        }
      }
      ctl.!default {
         type hw
         card 1
      }
 - "alsamixer" command can be used to check if the USB sound card is default.
 - If you are using Raspbian Jessie, alsa-utils must be rolled back to an early version.
 - Encoding of environment must be UTF-8.
 - More information is available at https://portal.vamk.fi/mod/resource/view.php?id=265871

2. Operating instructions

 - Plug in the USB sound card and setup the RPi3 as usual (SD card, power cable, Ethernet cable).
 - Run "make" command to build the project ("make clean" and "make archive" are also available).
 - Run "./sound.a" to execute the project.
 - Observe the columns visualizing the recorded sound in (almost) real-time and admire the beauty of technology.
 - Run "make clean" to delete the execution file.

 3. File manifest
